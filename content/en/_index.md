## Web site in transition

We're converting our web site to a new framework but we're not done. Please [report any problems](https://github.com/Interlisp/Interlisp.github.io/issues/).

## What is Medley Interlisp?

Interlisp was a software development environment developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s and 1980s to support research in many areas, including Artificial Intelligence, Graphical User Interfaces, and Computer-Supported Collaborative Work using HyperText. The software has many versions as it evolved over 25 years.

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Software development in Interlisp-D was a different experience than is common.
We hope to be able to not just demonstrate how it worked, but to revive the experimental development tools enough to share the ideas behind them. To make the software usable by current students of computer science, we need to overcome a number of problems.

In addition, there were a number of tools, demonstrations, and novel applications developed in the system, that also should be revivable. 

## What have we done so far?

As with any software that evolved over a long time, there's been quite a bit of cleanup and retrofitting. Among other developments, you can now run Medley Interlisp on many OS and hardware configurations, or at https://online.interlisp.org in the cloud. See our [2021 Annual Report](https://interlisp.org/2021AnnualReport.pdf) and [Project News](/news/).

## Who is involved?

We are some of the original developers of Interlisp and Interlisp-D through the 70s and 80s, along with interested participants. We work with [Partners](partners).
