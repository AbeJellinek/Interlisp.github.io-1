## GitHub

The [Interlisp](https://github.com/Interlisp) organization on GitHub contains re;ositories for the main [Medley](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley) Lisp code, build scripts and GitHub automation, the C-coded virtual machine, called [maiko](https://github.com/Interlisp/maiko), and documentation (including [this web site](https://github.com/Interlisp/Interlisp.github.io). 

Bugs, feature requests, and questions are best posted as [GitHub issues in the Medley repository](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues). Do check to see if your issue or question is answered there.

## Meetings

We have a weekly meeting on Mondays on Zoom. Meetings are to report accomplishments, status,  plans, and problems, and discuss directions. Meetings are recorded, but recordings are not public, just us. If you'd like to join in, [let us know](mailto:inco@lispcore.com).

__Monday, 1:00 pm ET / 10:00 am PT  

### Meeting Agendas and Notes

* These will be posted here, but we haven't completed transition from using [the medley wiki](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/).
* It seems likely will use Google docs for distributing meeting agendas and taking notes. For now meeting recordings are on Google Drive, but it's possible that we'll switch to "private" YouTube for holding meeting recordings.

## EMail and access groups

There are two Google groups in use: [Interlisp](mailto:interlisp@googlegroups.com) and [LispCore](mailto:lispcore@googlegroups.com) with respective archives. The archives are public. The LispCore group has access to meeting recordings, agenda, gets more mail (at least lately).

* The email alias [info@interlisp.org](mailto:info@interlisp.org).

* Interlisp.org is a Google work group; "interlisp.org" email addresses and aliases are available.

* InterlispOrg Inc is a non-profit 501c3 corporation. We accept donations.
